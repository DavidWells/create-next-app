# next-react-app

Bare bones react app using `next.js` as dev & build. Drop in replacement for create-react-app

## Inspiration

Inspired by [Replacing Create React App with the Next.js CLI](https://gist.github.com/tannerlinsley/65ac1f0175d79d19762cf06650707830) & [https://github.com/selrond/next-react-app](https://github.com/selrond/next-react-app)
